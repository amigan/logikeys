# example configuration
# for the logitech "corded keyboard"
# requires xmms-pipe be running to run (might fix in a later version)
# general format of lines is
# scancode:action
# If action starts with '|' it is in the format of
# |/pipe/filename|text to write
# If action starts with '=' it means "use the same pipe handle as scancode X"
# In all other cases, action is just a command (" &" will be appended to run in the background)
